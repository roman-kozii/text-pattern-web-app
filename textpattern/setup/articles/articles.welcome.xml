* Change this site's name, or select a different URL style? It's all up to your "preferences":adminurl/index.php?event=prefs.

* Add one or more "additional users":adminurl/index.php?event=admin, or extend Textpattern's capabilities with "plugins":adminurl/index.php?event=plugin from the "Textpattern plugin directory?":https://textpattern.com/plugins
* Dive in and learn by doing? Please note:
** When you "write an article":adminurl/index.php?event=article you assign it to a section of your site.
** Sections use a "page template":adminurl/index.php?event=page and a "style":adminurl/index.php?event=css to define how site content appears in a browser.
** Page templates use HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and "Textpattern tags":https://docs.textpattern.io/tags/ (like this: @<txp:article />@) to build the output code.
** Some Textpattern tags use "forms":adminurl/index.php?event=form, which are building blocks for reusable code and markup.
** Pages, styles and forms can be packaged into "themes":adminurl/index.php?event=skin and assigned to one or more sections.

Textpattern tags, their attributes and values are explained within the "Textpattern User Documentation":https://docs.textpattern.io/, where you will also find valuable examples, advice and tutorials.

There's also a group of friendly, helpful Textpattern users and administrators at the "Textpattern support forum":https://forum.textpattern.io/.

Additional language translations and corrections are welcomed. Please visit "Textpattern language translations":https://textpattern.com/languages for further details.
