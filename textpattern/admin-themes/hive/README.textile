h1. Hive admin-side theme (Classic Yellow) for Textpattern CMS

You are free to modify this theme, reuse code herein, and distribute all its supporting files as long as licences are respected (see below).

h2. Installation instructions

# Upload the directory 'hive' into your Textpattern installation -> admin-themes directory.
# Log in to your Textpattern admin area. Navigate to admin -> preferences -> admin.
# Select 'Hive (Classic Yellow)' from the 'Admin-side theme' dropdown list. Save the preferences.

h2. Optional custom CSS file toggle for advanced users

We provide an optional user-defined custom CSS file for customization of the admin-side theme, this is located at: assets -> css -> custom.css. Enable this file by uncommenting (or adding) the following line within your Textpattern @config.php@ file (before the closing @?>@ line):

bc. define('admin_custom_css', true);

You can then uncomment any of the pre-made rules within the CSS file - or add your own rules - to customize the admin-side theme to your requirement.

*Note:* be careful not to overwrite your own custom rules when updating to a new version of Textpattern!
