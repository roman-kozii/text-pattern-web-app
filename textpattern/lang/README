== Language Files ==

All language strings used by Textpattern CMS are stored in the database.
You can change your site language and/or user interface language
independently by selecting from the installed languages in the
Admin -> Languages panel. You may also install additional languages from
there.

All language strings are installed from files in the /textpattern/lang
directory. If you wish to update any language to use the latest strings:

1. Visit https://github.com/textpattern/textpacks/tree/master/textpacks
2. Click the language you want.
3. Click 'Raw' to view the file directly.
4. Download it from your browser.
5. Upload it to your server in the textpattern/lang directory.
6. Visit the Admin -> Languages panel.
7. Click 'Update' alongside the language in the grid.
